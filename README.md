# Machine Learning - Diabetes Prediction
**Description**
<br />Create a machine learning model to predict that the person has diabetes or not.

**Context**
<br />The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney Diseases. 
<br />The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a 
patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

**Content**
<br />The dataset consists of several features like number of pregnancies, BMI, Age, Blood 
Pressure, Insulin level, Glucose level, Diabetes Pedigree Function and the target variable the 
outcome i.e. is the person suffering from diabetes (1) or not (0).

**Steps To Consider**
1. Create a Dataframe from the dataset
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis 
3. Consider the data into features and Target(splice into input and output)
4. Split data into training and testing
5. Perform preprocessing (if required)
6. Apply ML algorithm (using Sklearn library) for the above training data
7. Predict for Testing Data
8. Evaluate the test result by considering Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix

**Technical Stack**
<br />I have used the Google Colaboratory.
<br />Import datasets from external sources is easy such as Kaggle.
